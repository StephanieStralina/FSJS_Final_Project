# FSJS_Final_Project

Hello!

This is my FSJS Project for Code Louisville. This site helps users
aggregate images and links to recipes from other blogs. You can add
a recipe, update the caption or links, and delete recipes. Future
functionality includes individual user logins, view engine templating,
saved recipes lists, and sorting recipes by calories,
type of meal & macros.

To run this project:
1. Go to directory of Project (FSJS_Final_Project/FinalProjectAPI7.20.17/)
2. Make sure nodemon and mongodb are installed
3. Run 'npm install' (to install dependent packages)
4. Run 'mongod' to start mongo database service
5. Run 'npm start' to begin server
6. Open the localhost window (localhost:3030)
